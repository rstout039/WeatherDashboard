# WeatherDashboard
For this activity I created a weather dashboard that is able to track and present a certain locations weather data for 5 days. <br>
When you search for a city you are presented with current and futre weather conditions for that city.
In addition, that city is added to your search history.
When you view weather conditions for the city you are presented with the name of the city, the date, the icon representation of the conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV Index.
When you view the UV Index, you are presented with colors that represent whether the codions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
When you view future conditions you are presented with a 5 day forecast that includes name of the city, the date, the icon representation of the conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV Index.
When you click on search history, you are presented the current and future weather conditions for that city.
When you open up the weather dashboard you are presented with the conditions of the last searched city.
